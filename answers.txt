Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin Scheduling.


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 958.5 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A or Exercise 4B?


Exercise 5:

The first clock interrupt occurs during process 4. In the pattern shown, the first deviation from the regular round-robin schedule is when process 1 is shceduled after process 3. This means that the interrupt occurred during process 4, which caused schedule() to be called. The round-robin scheduler then scheduled process1 ( since 1 comes after 4). This caused 1 to be run after 3.


(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)

Exercise 8:

The alternate locking method implemented was through system calls. Two systems calls sys_lock_acquire() and sys_lock_release() were implemented. The interrupt codes used for them were INT_SYS_USER2 and INT_SYS_USER3 respectively. These are defined in schedos-app.h. The preprocessor symbols for the compliation of this alternate locking scheme is PART8. If PART8 is defined, it will be compiled. Else the scheme from Part 6 will be used.
